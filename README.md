# Tamil-Breviary
A Project to Auto Generate Roman Catholic Tamil Breviary. This uses [Tamil-Bible](https://github.com/jayarathina/Tamil-Bible-Database), [Tamil-Lectionary](https://github.com/jayarathina/Tamil-Catholic-Lectionary) and [Roman-Calendar-Generator](https://github.com/jayarathina/Roman-Calendar) as its foundation.

It will be viable only when those projects become mature. So in the mean time, here **I will add the text file with data that can be later added to the database** when I start working on the project.
